## üöÄ Available Seeding Scripts

### 1. **seed-large-dataset.js** (Just Executed)
```bash
node seed-large-dataset.js
```
**Configuration:**
- 60 users (10 supervisors, 50 staff)
- 6,000+ timesheet entries
- 180 days of historical data

### 2. **seed-demo-data.js** (Small Dataset)
```bash
node seed-demo-data.js
```
**Configuration:**
- ~8 users
- ~200 timesheet entries
- 45 days of data
- Good for quick testing

---

## üéõÔ∏è Customizing the Dataset

You can modify `seed-large-dataset.js` to generate more or less data:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  NUM_STAFF: 50,           // Change to 100, 200, etc.
  NUM_SUPERVISORS: 10,     // Change to 20, 30, etc.
  ENTRIES_PER_USER_MIN: 60,    // Min entries per user
  ENTRIES_PER_USER_MAX: 150,   // Max entries per user
  DAYS_BACK: 180,          // Days of historical data (180 = 6 months)
};
```

### Example Configurations:

**Small Dataset (Fast):**
```javascript
NUM_STAFF: 20
NUM_SUPERVISORS: 5
ENTRIES_PER_USER_MIN: 30
ENTRIES_PER_USER_MAX: 60
DAYS_BACK: 90
```
*Result: ~25 users, ~1,000 entries*

**Medium Dataset:**
```javascript
NUM_STAFF: 50
NUM_SUPERVISORS: 10
ENTRIES_PER_USER_MIN: 60
ENTRIES_PER_USER_MAX: 150
DAYS_BACK: 180
```
*Result: ~60 users, ~6,000 entries* ‚úÖ **Current**

**Large Dataset (Slow):**
```javascript
NUM_STAFF: 100
NUM_SUPERVISORS: 20
ENTRIES_PER_USER_MIN: 100
ENTRIES_PER_USER_MAX: 250
DAYS_BACK: 365
```
*Result: ~120 users, ~20,000+ entries*

**Extra Large Dataset:**
```javascript
NUM_STAFF: 200
NUM_SUPERVISORS: 40
ENTRIES_PER_USER_MIN: 150
ENTRIES_PER_USER_MAX: 400
DAYS_BACK: 730  // 2 years
```
*Result: ~240 users, ~60,000+ entries*

## üìù Sample User Credentials

All users have the password: `admin123`

### Admins:
- `admin@aja.com` - Admin User (Operations)

### Supervisors (Sample):
- `lebo.molefe@aja.com` - Legal
- `neo.dube@aja.com` - IT
- `thabo.khoza@aja.com` - Finance
- *(+ 7 more randomly generated)*

### Staff (Sample):
- `jane.staff@aja.com` - Legal
- `peter.khoza@aja.com` - IT
- `thato.gare@aja.com` - HR
- `dineo.moyo@aja.com` - Finance
- *(+ 46 more randomly generated)*

## üîÑ Re-running the Seeder

The seeding script is **idempotent** for users (uses `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`), but will:
- ‚úÖ Keep existing users (updates their info)
- ‚úÖ Add NEW timesheet entries each time you run it

### To Start Fresh:

```sql
-- Clear all timesheet entries
DELETE FROM timesheet_entries;

-- Clear all users (except admin)
DELETE FROM users WHERE email != 'admin@aja.com';

-- Then re-run the seeder
node seed-large-dataset.js
```

---

## üìä Database Statistics

After seeding, you can view statistics:

```sql
-- Department summary
SELECT 
  department,
  COUNT(*) as entries,
  ROUND(SUM(total_hours), 2) as total_hours,
  ROUND(AVG(total_hours), 2) as avg_hours
FROM timesheet_entries
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY total_hours DESC;

-- User summary
SELECT 
  u.first_name,
  u.last_name,
  u.department,
  u.role,
  COUNT(te.id) as entries,
  ROUND(SUM(te.total_hours), 2) as total_hours
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN timesheet_entries te ON u.id = te.user_id
GROUP BY u.id
ORDER BY total_hours DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Status distribution
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM timesheet_entries
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Monthly breakdown
SELECT 
  DATE_FORMAT(date, '%Y-%m') as month,
  COUNT(*) as entries,
  ROUND(SUM(total_hours), 2) as hours
FROM timesheet_entries
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(date, '%Y-%m')
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

   - Search and filter performance
   - Export to Excel/CSV with large datasets

4. **User Roles**
   - Login as different supervisors
   - Login as different staff members
   - Test department-specific views

5. **Date Range Analytics**
   - 6 months of historical trends
   - Week-over-week comparisons
   - Seasonal patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Error: ER_DUP_ENTRY"
This is normal if you re-run the script. Users are updated, not duplicated.

### "Too slow"
Reduce the number of users or entries per user in the CONFIG.

### "Not enough data"
Increase the numbers in CONFIG and re-run.

### "Database connection error"
Check your `.env` file has correct database credentials:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=aja_timesheet
DB_PORT=3306
```
