# ✅ **SIMPLE CORS FIX APPLIED!**

## 🔧 **What I Fixed:**

I've added a **simple, explicit CORS handler** at the very beginning of your `server.js` file that will:

1. ✅ **Log all CORS requests** for debugging
2. ✅ **Allow your specific domains**:
   - `https://timesheet.aja.co.bw` (frontend)
   - `https://timesheetbackend.aja.co.bw` (backend)
   - Both HTTP and HTTPS variants
3. ✅ **Handle preflight requests** explicitly
4. ✅ **Set all required CORS headers**

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps:**

### **1. Upload Updated server.js:**
- Upload the updated `server.js` file to cPanel
- This file now has the CORS fix at the very beginning

### **2. Restart Node.js Application:**
- Go to cPanel → Node.js Applications
- Restart your application
- The startup file should still be `server.js`

### **3. Check Logs:**
- Look for CORS messages in the logs:
  - `🌐 CORS Request from: https://timesheet.aja.co.bw`
  - `✅ CORS: Allowed origin: https://timesheet.aja.co.bw`
  - `🔄 CORS: Handling preflight request`

## 🧪 **Test the Fix:**

### **1. Health Check:**
```
https://timesheetbackend.aja.co.bw/health
```

### **2. Test Login from Frontend:**
- Go to: `https://timesheet.aja.co.bw`
- Try to login
- Check browser console for CORS errors

### **3. Check Server Logs:**
- Look for the CORS debug messages
- Should see: `✅ CORS: Allowed origin: https://timesheet.aja.co.bw`

## 🔍 **If Still Having Issues:**

### **Check Server Logs:**
- Look for CORS debug messages
- Should see the origin being logged
- Check if it's being allowed or blocked

### **Browser Developer Tools:**
- Network tab → Look for OPTIONS requests
- Check response headers for CORS headers
- Look for any error messages

## ✅ **Expected Result:**
- ✅ No CORS errors in browser console
- ✅ Login should work successfully
- ✅ Server logs show CORS requests being allowed

## 🎉 **This Simple Fix Should Work!**

The CORS handler is now at the very beginning of the middleware stack, so it will catch all requests before any other processing. This should definitely resolve the CORS issue!
